Naruto Themed Final Fantasy Tactics

The plan is to create an isometric, turn-based, RPG similar to the original Final Fantasy Tactics (FFT) but with a Naruto theme.

The gameplay will be similar to FFT, but the characters and storyline will be based on the Naruto anime series, featuring all the main characters and their respective moves.

The game will be entirely web-based.
